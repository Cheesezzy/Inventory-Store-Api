# Inventory-Store-Api

Summitech Computing Ltd Assessment

Using NodeJS/ExpressJS and SQL, build a RESTful API that allows organizations to
manage a simple inventory. The inventory is to accommodate items (products or
services) for sale.
Products have stocks/stock items attached to them e.g. Paracetamol (a product)
has the following stocks:

- 4 cartons with batchId pfizer001
- 1 carton with batchId pfizer004

The API should include endpoints for the following:

- Sign up
- Sign in
- Add product
- fetch products
- Add stock (with batchId and quantity. BatchIds are unique)
- Fetch stocks
